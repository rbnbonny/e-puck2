# e-puck2

For the course ‘Embedded Systems and Robotics’ a small project on basis of an e-puck2 robot was developed. This project is comprised of the following modules:
* Navigation through an orthogonal labyrinth
* Decoding of encountered barcodes
* Mapping of the structure of the traversed labyrinth
* Light and sound effects

The frontal time-of-flight (ToF) distance sensor, 4 IR proximity sensors, the camera, several LEDs, the buzzer, as well as both stepper motors were used for the implementation of aforementioned functions.
